# [Creating SOAP Web Services using JAX-WS](jaxenter.com /creating-soap-web-services-using-jax-ws-117689.html)
There are various ways of creating web services. In this post we are going to create a SOAP based web service
using JAX-WS, which is Java API for XML Web Services and we will deploy it under Tomcat.

One important point to remember is, both SOAP and REST style web services can be built using JAX-WS. There is a common misconception that JAX-WS is used for creating SOAP based web services and JAX-RS is used for creating REST style web services.
JAX-WS API is very rich and provides a handful of annotations to make developers life easy.
